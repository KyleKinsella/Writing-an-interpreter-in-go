# Writing-an-interpreter-in-go

## This is a brand new project for me, I have decided to learn about interpreters and how they operate. I didn't have the opportunity to do a module in college about this topic, so I decided that I wanted to learn how they work. I have bought: "Writing an interpreter in go by Thorsten Ball", and I'm working through his book to get an understand on how these systems work.
